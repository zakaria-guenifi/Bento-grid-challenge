## Overview
This is the third challenge I've completed from Frontend Mentor. It was definitely interesting, I explored CSS grid areas and responsive layouts, which helped reinforce my understanding of modern layout techniques. Overall, it was a fun and valuable challenge.

### The challenge
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

## My process
As usual, I started by setting up the design system, this time using only the JPG previews since the Figma file wasnâ€™t provided. I then moved on to building out the reset, utility classes, and custom properties, which made styling the HTML much cleaner and avoided repetitive CSS.
Finally, I focused on the components, which were the most challenging part of the project but also the most rewarding to implement.

### Built with
- Vanilla CSS
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- @layer CSS structure
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
This challenge really helped me get more comfortable with grid areas, where I spent a lot of time tweaking and experimenting with different layouts. I also used @layer for the first time, It was a bit tricky at times, especially working from just JPGs instead of a Figma file, but that made the process more interesting and rewarding.
